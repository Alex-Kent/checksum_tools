# Sample ~/.checksum_tools file
# 
# This file contains user-specified defaults values for most command line 
# options.  Options specified on the command line override those given in this
# file.  Note that not all options can be overridden on the command line if
# given here; to override those use the --no-user-settings-file command line 
# option (which prevents all defaults given in this file from being used).
#
# Options should be listed one per line.
# 
# For options that take a parameter, the syntax is the option name followed by
# a single whitespace character (space or tab) with the remainder of the line
# being used as the option's parameter.  Parameters must not be escaped nor be 
# surrounded by quotation marks.
# 
# Any options not supported by a given command will be ignored.
# 
# All lines starting with a # are ignored.
# 
# Uncomment (and edit when applicable) the options that you want set by default.


# Only act if the entire object would be affected.
# For example, running prune_dirs on an object with this option active will
# only perform deletions if the entire object would be deleted.

# -a
# --all-or-nothing



# Do not delete or move any files
# (.md5sums and extended attribute metadata may be updated)

# -A
# --no-act



# Use a built-in function to copy files (instead of using e.g. "cp -ap"); this
# is also used when copying files or moving files across devices.
# (not currently implemented)

# -b
# --built-in-copy



# Compute and store MD5 checksums when not present (default)

# -c
# --compute-missing



# Discard existing checksums and recompute them

# -d
# --discard-existing



# Directories holding only symlinks or subdirectories (no regular files) are
# considered empty.

# -E
# --ignore-symlinks



# When symlinking always use absolute links

# -L
# --link-absolute



# When symlinking always use relative links

# -l
# --link-relative



# Move duplicate files into the directory DIR

# -m DIR
# --move-dupes DIR



# Also show full path when displaying duplicates or orphans

# -N
# --long-names



# For a file to match it must have same filename (case- insensitive) as well
# as the same fingerprint. At some point a --case-insensitive option may be
# added; if this is done, the --same-name option will be case-sensitive unless
# case-insensitivity is explicitly requested.

# -n
# --same-name



# Allow overwriting of existing files

# -O
# --overwrite



# Never overwrite existing files
# Attempting to overwrite an exising file will display a warning to STDERR
# then continue.

# -P
# --preserve



# Suppress progress messages

# -q
# --quiet



# Don't write anything to STDERR

# -Q
# --silent



# Do not recurse into subdirectories

# -R
# --no-recurse



# Recurse into subdirectories (default)

# -r
# --recurse



# Don't cross filesystem boundaries while recursing

# -x
# --one-filesystem



# Don't compute or store missing MD5 checksums

# --no-compute-missing



# Escape special characters in file and directory names
# 
# MODE can be octal, hex, HEX, shell, uri, or URI.
#
# In shell mode strings with special characters will have them octal encoded
# and wrapped so as to be suitable for direct shell usage (i.e. ESCAPED
# becomes $'ESCAPED').
#
# In both URI modes strings with special characters will have them hex encoded
# in a format suitable for usage in a URI (i.e. as %XX where X is a hex digit).
#
# Lowercase hex digits are output in hex and uri modes. Uppercase hex digits
# are output in HEX and URI modes.

# --escape-filenames MODE



# If set then neither extended attributes nor the .md5sums files will be
# written to under any circumstances.

# --never-rewrite-checksums



# If set then directories will be processed even if they contain a .no_md5sums
# file.

# --ignore-no_md5sums



# If set then checksums will only be written to extended attributes (.md5sums
# files will be not be written to under any circumstances).
# --only-write-xa



# Show checksum on all lines, not just the first

# --show-all-checksums



# Use terse output; MODE controls what is shown:
# dupe -> only duplicate file paths
# keep -> only kept file paths
# both -> both types, prefixed with DUPE: or keep:

# --terse MODE
