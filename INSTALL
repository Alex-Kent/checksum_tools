Basic installation
------------------

To install checksum tools run:

sudo make install

This will install the files as follows:

	Programs:             /usr/local/bin/
	Man pages:            /usr/local/share/man/man1/
	Other documentation:  /usr/local/share/doc/checksum_tools/

To change the installation location edit the Makefile and change the first 
line ("prefix = /usr/local") to the desired location.

To remove the software and its documention run:

sudo make uninstall


Required Perl modules
---------------------

The following Perl modules must be installed:

	Cwd
	Digest::MD5
	File::Basename
	File::ExtAttr
	File::Spec

These modules can be installed by running:

sudo cpan Cwd Digest::MD5 File::Basename File::ExtAttr File::Spec


3rd-party extended attribute support
------------------------------------

Some system software (e.g. KDE3/Trinity) doesn't copy extended attributes when 
copying files.  Modifiying such software to copy them is quite straightforward.
A patched version of the KDE3/Trinity libkio library is provided.  This can 
be used to add extended attribute support to KDE3/Trinity or as a model for 
added extended attribute support to other programs.  See the "Adding extended 
user attribute support to older software" section of README.md for details.
